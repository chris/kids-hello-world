Hello World is the classic first program created when learning a computer
language. All it does is print out “Hello World!”

This project contains examples of Hello World in a variety of languages to
give people a flavor for each. Many of the examples also add a few small
examples of other things like doing math, as printing Hello World is so
useless and doesn't give that much flavor :)

This was designed for teaching my kids. I make no excuse for my bias for
or against certain languages...

Each language directory contains its own README with instructions for how
you would run the program. This is all based on using MacOS X 10.8 or
later, and is typically just one way to do it. Nearly all languages that
don't come with MacOS X are installed with Homebrew. You can install
Homebrew by copying the following and pasting it in to Terminal:

`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"`
