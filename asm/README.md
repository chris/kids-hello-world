This is an assembly language version of Hello World. The assembly language
code for this was generated by taking a C program and compiling it to
assembly:

`gcc -Wall -O3 -m64 -fno-PIC hello.c -S -o hello.S`

That turns hello.c into hello.S. Then, you can turn around and compile that
with:

`gcc -m64 hello.S -o hello`

And finally, you can run it by doing:

`./hello`
